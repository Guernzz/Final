            <h1 style="color:white;" class="p1ha">OUR STORY</h1>
            <p style="color:white;" class="p1a">The first sample of our Covid-19 vaccine originated from the depths of the Amazon Forest. We sent out a team in search of ingredients essential to the production of the vaccine. In the matter of weeks our team of 20 students, guides and teachers were able to find something promising in the Amazon. Thanks to them weâ€™ve found a compound of elements that prove effective against the Covid-19 disease! Their hard work and tenacity on the mission drove them to success in discovering the vaccine.</p>

            <p class="p2a">With the success we found in the Amazon, we were then able to produce a vaccine! Lots of help from various companies donated money to assist our research. Our extensive lab research was needed to make a functional vaccine.</p>
